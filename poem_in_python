print("Twinkle twinkle little star \nHow I wonder what you are! \nUp above the world so high, \nLike a diamond in the sky.")
print("When the blazing sun is gone,\nWhen he nothing shines upon,\nThen you show your little light,\nTwinkle, twinkle, all the night.")
print("Then the traveler in the dark \nThanks you for your tiny spark,\nHow could he see where to go,\nIf you did not twinkle so?")
print("In the dark blue sky you keep,\nOften through my curtains peep\nFor you never shut your eye,\nTill the sun is in the sky.")
print("As your bright and tiny spark\nLights the traveler in the dark,\nThough I know not what you are,\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star.")
